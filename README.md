# Four-Quadrant Analog Multiplier
This repository presents the design of Four-Quadrant Analog Multiplier implemented using Synopsys Custom Compiler on 28nm Technology .

# Abstract
   Multiplication of two analog input signals is one of the most important factors which we need while working or performing operations in Analog Signal Processing. As, the
   multiplier is such type of a basic circuit that is used as a subcircuit in many of the other circuits, for example, it is used in analog computers, analog signal processing,
   etc. Up to now there are so many analog multipliers are designed with the reduction of power supply voltages, there are many CMOS existing analog multipliers are designed but 
   they are generally designed to be operated at higher supply voltages, which are unfortunately not suitable to be applied to battery-powered systems such as portable  
   communications systems equipment, some radio receivers, etc. 
   
   Therefore, in this paper, we are going to design a Low power consumption CMOS Analog Multiplier. The technique which we are going to use to make this design is a four-quadrant 
   technique. We are going to design CMOS Analog Comparator using 28nm technology. Design and Implementation of this circuit will be done in Synopsys Custom design platform that 
   is Synopsys custom design compiler tool.
